# Recursion Functions

This repository contains various recursive functions implemented in the C programming language.

## Functions

- `_puts_recursion`: Prints a string followed by a newline character.
- `_print_rev_recursion`: Prints a string in reverse.
- `_strlen_recursion`: Calculates the length of a string using recursion.
- `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- `_pow_recursion`: Calculates the power of a number using recursion.

## Usage

To use these functions:

1. Copy the function(s) you need from the provided code.
2. Include the necessary header file, `main.h`, in your program.
3. Call the function(s) in your code as needed.

Remember to compile and run your program using a C compiler.

Feel free to explore and use these functions in your C programs!
