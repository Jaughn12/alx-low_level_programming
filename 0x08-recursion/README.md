Recursion in C

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that involves a function calling itself. This README provides an overview of recursion in the C programming language and demonstrates its usage.
What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming concept where a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem. Each recursive call operates on a smaller input until a base case is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns the result.

Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving complex problems, especially those that exhibit repetitive structures or have a naturally recursive definition.
